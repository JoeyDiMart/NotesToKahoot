# NotesToKahoot
Created for Root Club, since we're beginning meetings going over Cybersecurity exams and prep.

Check out the makeXLSX.py file for the prompt. The main goal of this script is to take an AI generated list of questions and turn it into an excel file in the exact template for a Kahoot. There's also a prompt for notes already made.
